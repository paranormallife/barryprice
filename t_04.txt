&textHeading=Project: Old Road Renovation/Addition
Location: Tivoli, NY
Size: House 3770 sf
Completed: Spring '11

&text=This renovation project sought to overlay a modern spatial and surface sensibility on an architecturally neutral house.  The solution reconciles the visual and sound privacy required relative to the eastern road frontage with the openness and connection to the view on the west.  The project integrates modern detailing, differentiated/textured surfaces, and spatial openness with an upgraded high-performance building enclosure and HVAC system.
