&textHeading=Project: Switchback House
Location: Mount Tremper, NY
Size: 2800 sf Residence
Completed, Fall '07

&text=This house represents an effort to integrate the language of a classic modern dwelling with the form and palette of the regional vernacular.  The building form is intended as that of a switchback, reminiscent and expressive of the path required to ascend the site, and the form the building took to maximize the views and exposure that the site offered.  The ramp-like sloped roof forms overlap behind a monolithic bluestone chimney, which both marks the transition between rooflines, and anchors the building form to the site.  The attenuated form of the house and its appendages is visually constrained by a hoizontal galvalume metal band, and articulated by textured surfaces including horizontal and vertical bandsawn cedar siding, stucco and exposed poured concrete.
Composed of a primary structural steel frame and wood stick infill, the building interior recognizes the visual strength of the steel framing members woven into the building envelope, and offsets it with the rustic texture of bluestone and warm tonalities of stained white oak.
