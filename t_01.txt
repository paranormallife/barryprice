&textHeading=Project: River House and Studio
Location: Germantown, NY
Size: House 5100 sf, Studio 1260 sf
Completed: Spring '06

&text=This residence reflects an effort to reconcile traditional Japanese architecture with the language and tolerances of modern American construction. The House and Studio were designed to defer to the existing natural landscape while capturing views down to the adjacent Hudson River. Conceived as an attenuated compound, the house and studio rooflines deform at the northern and southern ends to define the linear proportioned exterior space, an interpretation of a traditional Japanese entrance courtyard.

The two buildings play off of each other in terms of their rooted and floating relationships to the ground, compositional articulation of mass and panelized wall surface, and interplay of abstracted traditional Japanese roof forms. The entire building composition is anchored by the 12' x 48' two story Douglas fir timberframe around which undulates the shallow sloped gable roof of the house, terminated by hips @ each end.

Perched on a bluff just above the River, and at the end of a driveway-linked necklace of clearings, the house offers a threshold between the journey into the property, and the relationship of the dwelling to the Hudson River.
