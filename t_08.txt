&textHeading=Project: Cedar House Addition/Renovation
Location: Woodstock, NY
Size: 735 sf Kitchen, Sitting Room and Screened Porch Addition
Completed, Spring '08

&text=This project introduced a 'free plan' to this previously compartmentalized 1970's era Cedar clad home.  By organizing all of the common spaces of the home concentrically around an open kitchen 'core,' the contiguous living spaces of the reconfigured interior engage the bucolic views to the north, and newly refined exterior spaces to the south and west.  Exterior finishes introduced clean lines and large scale fenestration to visually ground the variety of existing rooflines hovering above.
