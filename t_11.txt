&textHeading=Project: Mid-Century Modern Renovation
Location: Woodstock, NY
Size: 3400 sf 
Completed, Fall '08

&text=This project involved the renovation of a Mid-Century Modern House.  While much of the original house was undisturbed since its construction in 1948, the kitchen and bathrooms required period inspired updates.  In addition, many of what had been modified interior surfaces were upgraded to match the original specifications.  Glazing throughout the house was updated to increase thermal performance.
