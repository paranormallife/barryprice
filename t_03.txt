&textHeading=Project: Woodland Valley House
Location: Phoenicia, NY
Size: 2800 sf 
Completed, Spring '10

&text=This residence is an iteration of an ongoing study of the relationship of modernity to rusticity.  The building occupies a wooded site flanked by a significant stream and an open meadow.  The house is articulated by layered asymmetrical gables that both protect the house to the north, with the short eaves, and open it to the south with long eaves and deep overhangs.  Utilizing ‘live edge’ siding, a common finish in the locale, the house relies on the textures of contextual finishes balanced by the crispness of panelized surfaces, and modern detailing.
