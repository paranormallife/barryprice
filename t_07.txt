&textHeading=Project: Ledgesite Road Renovation
Location: Saugerties, NY
Size: House 4000 sf, Screened Porch Addition 260 sf
Completed: Spring '09

&text=This project was guided by the owner's intention to upgrade and refine the spaces and features of what was constructed as a modern/contemporary speculative house.
Originally developed and constructed by a designer/builder, the house exhibited a rustic-modern character that, while appealing, didn't accommodate the specific functional and aesthetic requirements the owners required of the house.
Accordingly the project undertook to reconfigure, refine and upgrade the interiors of the house, while simultaneously engaging exterior finish and interior system upgrades that would minimize maintenance liabilities and maximize the endurance of the house.
Accordingly a variety of exterior deck spaces, were replaced by simple roof forms, and displaced by the addition of a heavy timber screened porch addition, inspired by the original timber frame core of the living space of the house.
As a result, the house maintains a refined rusticity, consistent with the guiding principles of its construction, while providing the owners with the amenities they sought to incorporate into their home.
