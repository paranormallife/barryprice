&textHeading=Project: Farm Road Renovations
Location: Woodstock, NY
Completed: Fall '05

&text=In an effort to diffuse the abrupt relationship between the building and its surrounding landscape, the existing house received lattice structures flanking and overlapping its southeast and southwest corners.

The southwest fence/screen conceals exterior mechanicals, while the southeast structure transitions west to east masking the aluminum/glass greenhouse structure, and resolving as an attached pergola.
