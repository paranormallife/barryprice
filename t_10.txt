&textHeading=Project: 4WD House
Location: Lake Hill, NY
Size: 2000 sf Residence
Completed, Summer '07

&text=Situated on a sloped south facing mountain site, the house was designed to maximize solar exposure and minimize its footprint. The core of the house rises vertically from a basement footprint through the main/common level to the upper/bedroom level.  Accommodating bedrooms, bathrooms and circulation areas, the main level of the core expands into the contiguous living, dining, kitchen, screened porch and deck spaces, 'floating' above the descending grade as it presents the house to the intimacy of the wooded site, and the drama of the views beyond.
