&textHeading=Project: Rake House
Location: Esopus, NY
Size: 3400 sf 
Completed, Fall '09

&text=The house represents an effort to integrate the shapes and textures of rural building forms with the spatial opportunities and systems availed by modern and sustainable building systems and practices. Simple departures from rectilinear form, offered by the linear rake of the roof edges, inform the massing of the whole building. The house acts as a threshold between the northern road adjacency, and the direct southern open space and views.  Utilizing existing grades, the house is accessed at a split level between the Base and First Floors, minimizing the descent to the contiguous south facing living spaces.
